The slater.py is written to simplify the process of finding and converting the ATOM.slater file that SO-QWalk can read.

For use, simply python slater.py. You will need to input 

1. The name of the atom
2. The path of the dirac input file
3. The path of the dirac output file
4. The number of multiplets you want to get for this given state

The code will give out some ATOM_stateN.slater which are readable to the SO-QWalk.

This code doesn't take care of the ATOM.orb file.
