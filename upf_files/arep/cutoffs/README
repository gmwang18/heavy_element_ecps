to perform the cutoff measurement, first copy the template to whatever name you want it to have. Then add the upf file for that element into each directory's sub directory "pseudos". Once that is done find the .py script in each directory and alter it have the correct name for the element, the correct net spin, number of electrons and lastly the total magnitization which should be the same as the net spin for these atomic cases. Then alter the analyze.sh script's first line to have the correct number of electrons. Delete the runs directory from each subdirectory and run the python scripts for each subdirectory using a virtual environment setup to use nexus and once all of the data is done running, assuming everything was run properly, run "bash analyze.sh" in the top directory for the element. It will produce several files, energy.dat, processed.dat, and result.out. Energy.dat contains the cutoffs with the energies in Rydbergs, processed has the cutoffs with the errors in eV per electron for each cutoff, and result.out has just the cutoff for which the error drops below 1meV/e and the error. For convenience, a script was placed in the top level of this directory to run all of the cutoffs and produce a simple list of each element with it's corresponding cutoff in table.dat file.
