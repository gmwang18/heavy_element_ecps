     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on      32 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:                32
     Threads/MPI process:                     1

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      32
     Reading input from scf_560.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PBE ( 1  4  3  4 0 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want


     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     the system is metallic, specify occupations

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     one sub-group per band group will be used
     scalapack distributed-memory algorithm (size of sub-group:  4*  4 procs)

     Message from routine setup:
     DEPRECATED: symmetry with ibrav=0, use correct ibrav instead
